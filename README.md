# Pokemon Click

## Overview
This is a basic web app game build with react. This is my first app build with React so it is a little fundimental. The objective of the game is to click all of the game picture tiles without clicking the same one twice. After every click the board shuffles. To help the player out I added a state that shows the last tile the player clicked on. 

## Components
This game was built using 4 basic components:
* NavBar: basic nav bar that is seperate from the game board
* Character: this component stores the picture and data about the pokemon and wraps it in a div
* CharDiv: this maps and holds all of the different pokemon in the array]
* Board: this renders the CharDiv and holds all the game logic as well as the array for the different pokemon

## Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* React
